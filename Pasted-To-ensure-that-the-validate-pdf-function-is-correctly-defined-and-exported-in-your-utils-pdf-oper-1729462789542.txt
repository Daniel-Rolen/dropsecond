To ensure that the `validate_pdf` function is correctly defined and exported in your `utils/pdf_operations.py` file, let's review the provided code.

### Review of the `pdf_operations.py` Code

1. **Function Definition**: The `validate_pdf` function is indeed defined in your provided code:
   ```python
   def validate_pdf(file):
       try:
           PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
           file.seek(0)  # Reset file pointer
           return True
       except PyPDF2.errors.PdfReadError:
           return False
   ```

2. **Function Purpose**: The function attempts to read a PDF file using `PyPDF2.PdfReader`. If it can read the file without throwing an error, it returns `True`, indicating the PDF is valid. If it encounters a `PdfReadError`, it returns `False`.

3. **Exporting the Function**: To ensure that the function is usable in other parts of your application, you need to make sure it is included in the module's exports. Since you haven't shown any `__all__` directive or explicit export statements, it will be automatically exported if the module is imported.

### Guidance on Integration

- **Ensure Import in Main Application**: Make sure that `validate_pdf` is imported in your main application or wherever you need to use it. For example, in your Flask route where you're adding PDFs, you should have:
  ```python
  from utils.pdf_operations import validate_pdf
  ```

- **Usage Example**: Hereâ€™s how you might use the `validate_pdf` function in your Flask route:
  ```python
  @app.route('/add_pdf', methods=['POST'])
  def add_pdf():
      file = request.files['file']
      if file and file.filename.endswith('.pdf'):
          if not validate_pdf(file):
              return jsonify({"error": "Invalid PDF file"}), 400
          pdf_info = get_pdf_info(file)
          return jsonify(pdf_info)
      return jsonify({"error": "Invalid file"}), 400
  ```

### Summary

- The `validate_pdf` function is correctly defined in the provided code.
- Ensure that it's properly imported where needed in your application.
- It should be used to validate PDF files in your routes to enhance user feedback and application robustness.

If you need to make modifications or additional features related to this function, you could also add logging for validation errors or integrate user feedback in your frontend to indicate PDF validity.
