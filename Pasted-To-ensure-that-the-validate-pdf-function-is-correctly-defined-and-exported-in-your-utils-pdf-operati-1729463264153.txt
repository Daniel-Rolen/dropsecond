To ensure that the validate_pdf function is correctly defined and exported in your utils/pdf_operations.py file, let’s review the code step-by-step for correctness and syntax issues.

Review of the Code
Here’s the provided code, annotated for clarity:

python
Copy code
import PyPDF2
import fitz  # fitz is usually used for PyMuPDF, but not needed in this code.

def get_pdf_info(file):
    pdf = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
    return {
        "filename": file.filename,
        "pages": len(pdf.pages)
    }

def compile_pdfs(pdfs, output_path, use_cover, cover_pages, cover_sheet_index):
    merger = PyPDF2.PdfMerger()
    
    if use_cover and cover_sheet_index >= 0:
        cover_pdf = pdfs[cover_sheet_index]
        file_path = cover_pdf['filename']
        cover_range = parse_page_range(cover_pages)
        merger.append(file_path, pages=cover_range)
    
    for index, pdf in enumerate(pdfs):
        if index == cover_sheet_index and use_cover:
            continue
        
        file_path = pdf['filename']
        pages = pdf['pages']
        content_range = parse_page_range(pages)
        merger.append(file_path, pages=content_range)
    
    merger.write(output_path)
    merger.close()

def parse_page_range(range_str):
    pages = []
    for part in range_str.split(','):
        if '-' in part:
            start, end = map(int, part.split('-'))
            pages.extend(range(start - 1, end))
        else:
            pages.append(int(part) - 1)
    return pages

def validate_pdf(file):
    try:
        PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
        file.seek(0)  # Reset file pointer
        return True
    except PyPDF2.errors.PdfReadError:
        return False
Checks for Function Definition and Export
Function Definition: The validate_pdf function is correctly defined. It attempts to read a PDF file and returns True if successful or False if it encounters a PdfReadError.

Exporting Functions: In Python, functions defined at the module level (i.e., not nested within another function or class) are automatically exported. Therefore, validate_pdf can be imported without any additional export statements.

Importing the Function: In another file, you can import the function like this:

python
Copy code
from utils.pdf_operations import validate_pdf
Syntax Check
Upon reviewing the code, there are no syntax errors. The functions are properly defined, and the logic appears sound. However, here are a couple of considerations:

Unused Import: The import fitz statement is present but not utilized in this file. If it’s not needed elsewhere, it’s best to remove it to avoid confusion.

Error Handling: The error handling in validate_pdf is straightforward and handles the specific PdfReadError well.

Conclusion
Functionality: The validate_pdf function is correctly defined and can be imported as intended.
No Syntax Errors: There are no syntax errors in the code that would prevent the function from being imported.
If DevOps is still facing issues importing the function, they should check:

The directory structure and ensure that the utils package is properly recognized (i.e., it contains an __init__.py file).
Their Python environment settings to ensure it can access the relevant directories.
This should help clarify and resolve any remaining questions about the validate_pdf function and the overall integrity of the pdf_operations.py file.
